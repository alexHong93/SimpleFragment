WELFARE AND ADVERSAIAL LEGALISM
Even tort sys goes politicalized what how about welfare???? where is the law???
Where the court involved in welfare?

Characteristics of US sys
- Early and sustained commitment to public education at all levels
- Less commitment to other components
	-> welfare, unemployment, disability, health care... after WW2 the universial education spread to other fields
- More concern about perceived costs
	-> taxes
	-> economic inefficiencies
	-> moral hazards (e.g induced laziness)
- Decentralized coordination //the way we structured the sys
	->mix of federal, state, local and private funds
	->mix of federal, state, and local rules (e.g. of eligibility) and incentives (e.g. tax breaks)
	->state, local, and private administration and delivery //fed actually not admin to welfare. even when you fund to health care it does not go to national clinic except veterans hospital
-Lower funding levels, more requirements //more hoops and less funding
-Detailed rules and rights as coordinating methods

Courts Involved!!!
- Sweeping rights, limited funding //unfunded mandate
	->ex) education for All handicapped children act(1974)//what qualifies handicap and learning ability, legality
-Means testing
	->ex) aid to families with dependent children (1935 - 1996)
//In us instead of giving basic money to all children, run a sys based on means
